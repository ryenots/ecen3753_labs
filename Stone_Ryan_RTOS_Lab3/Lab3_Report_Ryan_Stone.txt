# Lab 3 write up


## Part 1

16. If a callback takes too long, the next callback cycle will start regardless. This could cause many callbacks running in parallel (bad)

17. Depending on whether or not the gyro has been initialized, either garbage data would be read, or an old reading.

## Part 2

5.
a. Based on the processor speed, and the number of cycles required to execute the user code, the duty cycle can be calculated. For my own user code, I calculated the processor to be using about 1% of the 8MHz.

b. In order to determine which code was interrupted, the call stack on the left of the debugger can be used to see which function we are currently in, as well as parent functions. When running the task configuration of my project, I assumed that interrupting my code would land me somewhere in the HAL_DELAY function, because the majority of the time the programing will be delaying for the next loop cycle. Instead, I learned that the execution was instead in the seperate idle task.
