I was not able to get SystemView running. What I am experiencing is I start recording,
and the info box appears, but hangs at "recorder starting" with 1% progress. Eventually
the box disappears without any error. I've reproduced this on both linux and windows, so
I thought maybe it was an issue with my board. J-link seems to be working great with the
IDE. I replaced my entire project, and just put my code back in in case I caused any
issue with the segger files. I'm not sure how to proceed with the SystemView section of
the lab at this point.

3. I would assume the GyroInput task would match the timer period.
4. My assumption is that the LEDOutput task would be synchronized with the ButtonInput task,
    because the LEDOutput is awaiting new messages. ButtonInput sends new messages, causing
    LEDOutput to become active.

Summary of what I learned:
In this lab, I was reminded on the use of Semaphores. In the computer science degree track,
the class Operating Systems teaches this concept as well, so I was already familiar with the
concept. What was new for me was some of the other mechanisms the OS provides, such as the
message queue, and event flags. I also utilized the MemoryPool, so my message queue simply
contained a pointer to the message. This was not neccessary for the lab to function, but was
a good experience to understand in case the actual message was a larger data structure, which
shouldn't be put into a queue.

Functional tests:
The following functional tests are passing:
1. When rotating the board clockwise, the green led illuminates.
2. When rotating the board counter-clockwise, and holding the button, the red led
    illuminates.
3. Holding the button while the board is stationary causes both leds to illuminate.

I am not failing any functional tests I created, or any from previous labs.
I did not rename my project to LastName_FirstName format, because it broke functionality with
how some parts are not renamed in the IDE, and caused my project not to build.
