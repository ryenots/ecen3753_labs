A few things about this lab:

 - I could not rename the lab in Lastname_Firstname format using the IDE, because it would
totally break the build process. I think there are certain files or data within files
that are not renamed causing the issue, which I do not know how to fix.

 - This lab is "complete", but not functional, and I spent hours trying to debug the issue to
no avail. The issue is a hardfault within the osEventFlagsSet function (Line 382 in ApplicationCode).
I don't think the issue is actually this line, but instead something else, and the error is simply
revealed here. I communicated via Slack with classmates, LA's, and John about this issue,
and I never found a solution to the problem. Any insight would be most helpful, otherwise
I will attend office hours to see if there is anything I am missing here.

 - As for SystemView analysis, I was never able to get the program functional in the previous
lab, and nothing has changed since then, On top of this, my lab obviously does not run for
very long at all until the hardfault issue occurs.
