1. assumptions, lab is vague
2. 2 test cases
3. final EC: memory sizes

# Assumptions made:

For this lab, I decided to have the function for reading gyro velocity to return the 16 bit value, as opposed to writing to a shared global variable. Doing this avoids having to create a atomic code section, as the value longer than a single bit. This is different compared to the user button, which is a global shared variable. This variable is only ever assigned a 1 or 0, so it does not need to be in a critcal atomic section either, as the write will not be interrupted halfway through.

# Test cases:

1. For the first test case, I held the user button down while the board was stationary, meaning both LEDs are expected to power on. The expected behavior is what is as observed.

2. For the second test case, I held the user button down while rotating the board clockwise. The expected behavior is that the red LED should turn on. This is what occured. Next, I let go of the user button, and rotated the board counter-clockwise. In this case, the expected behavior is the green LED should turn on. This is also what occured.
